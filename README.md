# Neural-Nets-Library
A library for building and testing custom neural networks using the functional TensorFlow API.

Python 3.12 | TensorFlow 2.19.0

## Setup
WSL2 is highly recommended if working on Windows, since GPU support is limited without it. Clone repository and set up the virtual environment using:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
This will take a few minutes.

## Getting Started
Examples of how to build and train networks are included in the `basics.ipynb` notebook. To
